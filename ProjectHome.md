This library defines a class of smart pointers that can be used to create and manage dynamic objects and arrays, which are destroyed and freed by garbage collection when they are no longer referenced. These smart pointers are not based on reference counting. Garbage collection uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm. The library requires some C++11 features, and it has been compiled and tested in Linux with GCC 4.6.
